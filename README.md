# assembler_prog

Hi there!
this is an assembler program for a made up assembly language.
it is ready to activate on ubuntu machinces, using the makefile.
after that, just type in the bash "assembler file_name1 file_name2 ..." as many files as you need.
the files shoud have a signeture of ".as" in thier name, but dont use it on running.
I uploaded a file exmple of the assembly languge. 
have a good one!
